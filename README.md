As shown above, on mobile devices the interface looks and feels more native. It's sleek, clean, and uses darker colours that don't directly clash with others. The colour selection can be seen under "Branding"

### Long-Term Goals

We've got a set of long-term goals which are:

1. Make a CLI tool to generate blogs, pages (instead of using git clone & edit)
2. Add the ability to swap "papers" or "posts" for "documentation" section with a sleek and clean documentation interface
